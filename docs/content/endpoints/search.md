# /search

To perform a search, you just need to pass a text query to the API. Currently, the API doesn't support advanced filtering, but this is slated to come in a future update.

The API can support queries to either a song name (`songName`), a song subname (`songSubName`), an artist (`songAuthorName`), or a Beatmap level author (`levelAuthorName`). 

## Generally: /search/text/?q={Search Query}
### Song Name
_Example: https://beatsaver.com/api/search/text/?q=mine_

### Artist
_Example: https://beatsaver.com/api/search/text/?q=bazzi_

### Level Author
_Example: https://beatsaver.com/api/search/text/?q=flazerd_
